# TEMPLATE_REACT_NODE_PROFILE

This is a template project based on REACTJS, NODE and KeystoneJS
Inspired from [WESBOS Advanced-React](https://github.com/wesbos/Advanced-React/blob/master/stepped-solutions/57/frontend/Checkout.js)

With this template you can start a web site with :
- User authentication (login / logout)
- Account form
- Backend CMS with Keystone

You will need to 
- Create an account on [mongoDB Cloud](https://account.mongodb.com/)
- Rename backend/sample.env to .env and adjuste you configuration


## BackEnd

- Node
- KeystoneJS on MongoDB

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm install
```

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

## FrontEnd

- ReactJS

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm install
```

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```


Open [http://localhost:9999](http://localhost:9999) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `components/Site.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:9999/api/hello](http://localhost:9999/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
